Project that I created for a landing page. It includes HTML/CSS, and bootstrap for the design. I wanted to test making a lightweight, sleek design with minimal clutter.
I centered the title using CSS, and also added a colour change to the buttons when hovering over them. As of now the links only go to other websites in a new tab such as Facebook, but this concept could be used to make a multi page website.
Under the title that is centered is a subscribe button using a service named Mailchimp which allows you to follow the page. On my mailchimp account it shows who registered, their name, and email address.
